# Reinforcement Learning practical work
*Compilation of work and assignments with my solutions for reinforcement learning thematic.*

* **Dynamic Programming**  
Using dynamic programming methods (Policy Evaluation, Policy Improvement, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration...) to solve reinforcement learning problem in MDP context.  
  
* **Monte Carlo methods**  
Monte Carlo methods for reinforcement learning. The agent learns directly from episodes of experience without any prior knowledge of MDP transitions.
  
* **Bandits Strategies**  
Multi armed bandits problem. An agent chooses an action and each action returns a reward according to a given underlying probability distribution.
