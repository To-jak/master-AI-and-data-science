# KNN-algorithm-implementation
Simple implementation of the K-NN working with two datasets.

* [breast-cancer-wisconsin.data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data)
* [haberman.data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/haberman/haberman.data)

KNN function should work with any dataFrame with numerical values and the class label to predict in the last column, as long as there is no NaN value.

The loadAndSplitDataSet, as well as the plot functions, are specific for the two mentionned above data sets: they aim to clean the data and represent the obtained results.
